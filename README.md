# LightStudio_Done_API

This is a Minecraft donation integration plugin developed in Java.

## Features

*   **Asynchronous API Calls:** All external API calls are now asynchronous, improving server responsiveness and performance.
*   **Optimized Live Status Checking:** Live status checks are performed only when players are online, reducing unnecessary network traffic.
*   **Asynchronous Configuration Loading:** User data and whitelist refresh operations are now asynchronous, preventing server freezes during `/done reload`.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improved error handling for API calls and WebSocket connections.
